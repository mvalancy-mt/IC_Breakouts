S6AE101A_solar_harvester - 

"The S6AE101A is a power management IC (PMIC) for energy harvesting that is built into circuits of solar cells connected in series, output power control circuits, output capacitor storage circuits, and power switching circuits of primary batteries. Super-low-power operation is possible using a consumption current of only 250 nA and startup power of only 1.2 μW. As a result, even slight amounts of power generation can be obtained from compact solar cells under low-brightness environments of approximately 100 lx."

LTC3110_supercap_backup - 

"The LTC3110EFE#PBF is a bidirectional buck-boost DC to DC regulator with capacitor charger and balancer in 24 pin TSSOP package. Its wide 0.1V to 5.5V capacitor/battery voltage and 1.8V to 5.25V system backup voltage ranges make it well suited to wide variety of backup applications using super capacitors or batteries. A proprietary low noise switching algorithm optimizes efficiency with capacitor/battery voltages that are above, below or equal to system output voltage. The LTC3110 can autonomously perform transition from charge to backup mode or switch modes based on an external command. Pin selectable burst mode operation reduces standby current and improves light load efficiency which combined with 1μA shutdown current make the LTC3110 ideally suited for backup applications. The device also includes voltage supervisors for direction control and end of charge, general purpose comparator with open collector output for interfacing with microcontroller."
