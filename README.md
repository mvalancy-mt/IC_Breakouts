"The S6AE101A is a power management IC (PMIC) for energy harvesting that is built into circuits of solar cells connected in series, output power control circuits, output capacitor storage circuits, and power switching circuits of primary batteries. Super-low-power operation is possible using a consumption current of only 250 nA and startup power of only 1.2 μW. As a result, even slight amounts of power generation can be obtained from compact solar cells under low-brightness environments of approximately 100 lx."

"The LTC3110EFE#PBF is a bidirectional buck-boost DC to DC regulator with capacitor charger and balancer in 24 pin TSSOP package. Its wide 0.1V to 5.5V capacitor/battery voltage and 1.8V to 5.25V system backup voltage ranges make it well suited to wide variety of backup applications using super capacitors or batteries. A proprietary low noise switching algorithm optimizes efficiency with capacitor/battery voltages that are above, below or equal to system output voltage. The LTC3110 can autonomously perform transition from charge to backup mode or switch modes based on an external command. Pin selectable burst mode operation reduces standby current and improves light load efficiency which combined with 1μA shutdown current make the LTC3110 ideally suited for backup applications. The device also includes voltage supervisors for direction control and end of charge, general purpose comparator with open collector output for interfacing with microcontroller."

"The 18-channel 3-chip calibrated visible through near-infrared chipset is ideal for emerging spectral sensing applications such as horticulture, fluid quality/spectral component analysis and complex spectral identification, including anti-counterfeiting and authentication. Today’s announcement brings the new 2017 offerings from the AS726x multispectral sensing products to 4 unique solution sets, including 6-channel visible, near-IR, true color and 18-channel family members.

The AS7265x chipset consists of 3 highly integrated 6-channel sensor devices, each only 4.5 x 4.4 x 2.5mm, in efficient land-grid array packages with integrated apertures. The master-slave-slave architecture appears as a single logical device, simplifying system integration and decreasing time to market. The 18-channels span wavelengths from 410 to 940nm with 20nm filter widths."
